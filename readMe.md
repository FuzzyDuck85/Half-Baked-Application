7th August 2020

1 - Team coding serve side
2 - Created a User and Recipe models, repositories and controllers in IntelliJ
3 - In Recipe model, we needed to decide to import wholesale or build our own
4 - Recipe will hold a name and unique ID so an API call can be made, saving the need to write a lot of code.
5 - Fetch using the recipeID;
6 - Create DataLoader for testing purposes
7 - Tested via localhost:8080, initially user not displaying it's recipe. Thankfully not an issue.
8 - Back end parked, moved to front end.
9 - Creating MainContainer, RecipeContainer, ListContainer and SearchContainer  and components folders (list, recipe and search).
10 - To avoid DRY and additionally gitIgnore the API key we created helper files for the API URL and BackEndURL
11 - Now able to render placeholder containers to LocalHost:3000
12 - Begin work on generating a random recipe from the API to RecipeContainer
13 -  Created ListOfRecipies components
